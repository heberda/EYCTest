# EYCTest

This test is simple, I have hard coded a data set which is presented in a simple table.

**Planned enhancement**

Entity Framework & SQL - Had this project not been for an audience and I could guarentee SQL being in place it would have been easier to persist the data.

Create, Update & Read - Without saving to a file I didn't see the benefit. Reading and writing (parsing) files comes with too many potential bugs given the time frame.
